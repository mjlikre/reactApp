This little project created a memorization game, where the user will choose from the a list of images and try not to click on different images every time. If the user clicks on the image never clicked before, the score goes up by one and the order of the images change. However, if the user clickes on an image that has already been clicked on, this will reset the score and the player looses. 

Have fun playing the game, will probably add in more feasures in the future, as not know this is it!!!
